1.  There are some progress on the question system building, but still cannot 
become fully operational. Thus, we make a deadline for the function of 
admin questions on 6pm Nov 20.

2.  The functions of admin groups are almost completed except the adding users
to the group function.

3.  We decide to merge many branches together in this iteration.
