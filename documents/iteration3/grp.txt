Those things done by me:

1. Created a model Group with basic initialization fields in the database,
used default routes, and established a has_and_belongs_to_many relationship
with the User model.

2. Created a field with name "Group_admin" inside the User database,
to distinguish those group admins from power admin.

3. Created basic CRUD methods for group and views being rendered too.

4. Created a basic user control mechanism to prevent unauthorized, forced 
requests on the groups.

Things to be done:
1. Realized the add-to-group function and adapt the views.

2. Allow admins with different powers to choose different groups of users

3. Huge amount of tests on this part.

Good luck!
